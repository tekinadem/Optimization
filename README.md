A sudoku problem is a problem with an incomplete 9x9 table of numbers that must be filled according to several rules:
Within any of the 9 individual 3x3 boxes, each of the numbers 1 to 9 must be found.
Within any column of the 9x9 grid, each of the numbers 1 to 9 must be found.
Within any row of the 9x9 grid, each of the numbers 1 to 9 must be found.
On this repo we will formulate the problem (from wikipedia) as a model using PuLP. Once created, our code will need little modification to solve any sudoku problem.
